          <a href='https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics' target="_blank">Fine particulate air pollution</a>, or PM2.5 for short, is the general term for inhalable particles that are 2.5 micrometers or smaller (over 30 times thinner than a human hair). It can be emitted from natural or humanmade sources, including cars, power plants, and wildfires, and can be composed of hundreds of different chemicals.<br><br>

          Due to its small size, inhaling PM2.5 can allow it to enter the lungs and bloodstream, which can cause <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740125/' target="_blank">significant damage</a> over time. <a href='https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1104660' target="_blank">Decades</a> <a href='https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/194704' target="_blank">of</a> <a href='https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.1104049' target="_blank">research</a> has linked PM2.5 exposure with premature death in people with heart or lung disease, poor health indicators such as aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and nonfatal heart attacks, and many other adverse outcomes.<br><Br>

          In the United States, average PM2.5 levels have <a href='https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/particulate-matter-pm25-trends' target="_blank">declined steadily</a> since 2000. However, because research <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26038801/' target="_blank">has</a> <a href='https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1702747' target="_blank">not</a> <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118303256?casa_token=H9t_ZMj3q2UAAAAA:y7rKY9qlip9Mhr_ZkTuGNuedZNJo9PTPhcBBG1G7JbpkWDFUidX7HSsIgWhJk4Ffd8aEVuf7' target="_blank">identified</a> a ‘safe’ level of PM2.5, even lower levels of PM2.5 can result in thousands of deaths every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that if PM2.5 levels had been 25 percent lower across the US each year between 2001 and 2014, nearly 500,000 deaths could have been avoided (scroll down for more). For context, <a href='https://tinyurl.com/xzdb2d4j' target="_blank">in 2019</a> EPA staff scientists recommended tightening the EPA’s PM2.5 air quality standards from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3), which would have been a 25 percent reduction. (The EPA under the Trump administration <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/12/07/trump-air-pollution/'>ultimately rejected</a> this change).

        However, these death estimates do not reflect the full public health impact of PM2.5.
        First, as explained above, no safe level of PM2.5 has been found, and the CDC has only estimated potential deaths avoided assuming PM2.5 reductions of up to 25 percent. If PM2.5 levels were reduced even further, <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231013004548' target='_blank'>more deaths</a> would have likely been avoided. Further, recent developments in the research literature on PM2.5 have focused on its neurological effects. Evidence suggests that fine particulates <a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00613/full' target='_blank'>impair children's cognitive development</a> and <a href='https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/18/6931/htm' target='_blank'>negative affect their academic performance</a>. PM2.5 has also been linked to increased risk of <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1747493018772800' target='_blank'>dementia</a>, <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0147651319302519' target='_blank'>Alzheimer's disease</a>, and

        This burden of PM2.5 is not felt evenly across the US. Certain regions experience much more acute air quality problems than others:

        Despite the copious evidence on the adverse effects of PM2.5, regulation of PM2.5 is controversial in the United States.<br><br>

        Over its four years, the Trump administration <a href='https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/824431240/trump-administration-weakens-auto-emissions-rolling-back-key-climate-policy' target='_blank'>weakened</a> national auto emissions standards, <a href='https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/824431240/trump-administration-weakens-auto-emissions-rolling-back-key-climate-policy' target='_blank'>attempted to repeal</a> power plant emission restrictions, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/14/epa-pollution-coronavirus/' target='_blank'>rejected tightening</a> the national PM2.5 air quality standards, <a href='https://www.npr.org/2021/01/05/953579414/trump-epa-erects-new-barriers-to-crucial-science' target='_blank'>passed a new rule changing</a> which studies can be used to inform those standards, and <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html' target='_blank'>proposed a new methodology</a> for calculating the health risks of PM2.5 that would predict fewer deaths caused by air pollution. This came after the Obama administration enacted national <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/autos-must-average-545-mpg-by-2025-new-epa-standards-are-expected-to-say/2012/08/28/2c47924a-f117-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_story.html' target='_blank'>auto</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Power_Plan' target='_blank'>power plant</a> emission standards and <a href='https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/2012-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-naaqs-particulate-matter-pm' target='_blank'>implemented stricter standards</a> on PM2.5.<br><br>

        Because PM2.5 is not a hot-button topic of political discourse in the United States, these actions can be easy to miss. But even though the topic may be arcane, and though United States has made progress over the decades in reducing PM2.5, thousands of lives every year still hang in the balance.<br><br>
